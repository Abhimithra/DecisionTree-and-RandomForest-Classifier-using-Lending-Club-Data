# DecisionTree-and-RandomForest-Classifier-using-Lending-Club-Data
 
Project Descriptions: Lending Club connects people who need money (borrowers) with people who have money (investors). Hopefully, as an investor you would want to invest in people who showed a profile of having a high probability of paying you back. 

Data Source: Dataset taken from the source https://help.lendingclub.com/hc/en-us/articles/216127307-Data-Dictionaries

Project Requirements: Here I have used Decision Tree classifier and random Forrest classifier from Scikit learn package of Python.

Project Results: Built a Random Forest Classifier model on real time LendingClub data that can predict whether the borrower paid back their loan in full with a Precision of 81%. Built this Random Forest Classifier model on top of Decision tree Classifier to increase the prediction power of Decision tree Classifier and hence increased F1 score by 6%.
